Townsend Esq\nActing Chair Moore called the meeting to order and led the Pledge of Allegiance\nActing Chair Moore opened the Public Forum Mr Joseph Shields of Ferrara Fiorenza Larrison Barrett & Reitz\nPC representing the Greece Central School District (GCSD) noted that the GCSD adopted a resolution objecting to\nthe application for the custom PILOT both the February 2012 proposed 30 year PILOT and todays revised 25 year\nPILOT requested by Greece Town Mall Mr Shields offered further comment noting concerns about the inclusion\nof outparcels under the proposed PILOT agreement as well as concerns about the PILOT Analysis prepared by The\nBonadio Group Mr Shields noted that The Bonadio Group analysis concluded that the GCSD would be held\nharmless Mr Shields noted that GCSD engaged a real estate appraiser and financial analyst to conduct their own\nanalysis which concluded that there would be a loss of $6 Million - $8 Million in real property tax revenues under\nthe proposed PILOT agreement Mr Shields referencing the Uniform Tax Exemption Policy which says it will not\napprove a special PILOT program unless each of the taxing jurisdictions consent on behalf of the GSCD requested\nthat the board decline to approve the proposed PILOT deviation Mr Shields noting the JobsPlus program which\nwas approved for the DiMarco project on West Ridge Road asked if the analysis had been completed to determine\nif that program works for this project Mr Shields requested that the attached exhibits (Exhibit A Thurston and\nExhibit B - Blue Horizons)and transcripts of both public hearings and todays public forum (to be provided by Mr\nShields) be made part of the record Mr Shields noted that his client has not received an updated Bonadio analysis\nwhich was referenced in earlier public hearings Mr Shields noted that he had written to counsel on May 25 2012\n(Exhibit C attached) requesting a meeting and that no response has been received He asked that this letter be\nincluded in the public record\nTodd Thurston MAI of Thurston Casale & Ryan LLC representing the GCSD offered comments regarding the\nanalysis prepared by the Bonadio Group and concluded that the structure of the PILOT will result in an economic\nburden to the district with a loss to the school district of future tax receipts of $6 Million to $86 Million over the 25\nyear life of the PILOT\nTim Poley Blue Horizons Strategies Inc representing the GCSD offered comments regarding the analysis prepared\nby the Bonadio Group and concluded that the proposed PILOT which encompasses the main mall Target\nMcDonalds Regal Theater and the former Bon Ton and concluded that the amount of projected investment does\nnot warrant a 25 year PILOT and that JobsPlus program may be a better and more appropriate program for this\nproject Mr Poley requested that the board consider the full financial impacts of the proposed project noting the\nneed for a high degree of due diligence and financial scrutiny before entering into a long term PILOT agreement\nExecutive Director Seil read in to the record the remarks of the Town of Greece Supervisor Honorable John\nAuburger which were delivered at the Public Hearing of June 18 2012 in the Town of Greece Mr Auburger notes\n8100 CityPlace 50 West Main Street Rochester New York 14614\n(585) 753-2022 Fax (585) 753-2028 wwwgrowmonroeorg\n\fthat the Town of Greece is in favor of the PILOT agreement as it secures a steady stream of tax revenue without the\nuncertainty of decreasing values and will have a positive impact on sales tax revenue and will provide employment\nopportunities for the residents of Greece Supervisor Auburger noted assessments are not correlated to the rate of\ninflation they are market driven\nMr Thomas Bonadio The Bonadio Group offered comments regarding The Bonadio Group report noting that it\nwas not intended as an appraisal the decline in local commercial real estate values in upstate New York and that in\nlight of recently imposed tax levy cap the proposed PILOT represents a steady stream of income to the school\ndistrict Mr Bonadio noted the appraisal provided by Mr Thurston assumes inflation drives assessment and that is\nnot the case in Monroe County\nDennis Wilmot Wilmorite Inc offered comments regarding the project Mr Wilmot noted that required financial\ninformation for the mall and the proposed project had been provided to COMIDA Mr Wilmot expressed umbrage\nat the remarks that compared this project to the Destiny USA project in Syracuse Mr Wilmot asserted that the\nDestiny project is the beneficiary of PILOT Increment Financing whereas this project in seeking only a PILOT\nagreement Mr Wilmot asserted that such mall redevelopment projects are not typically financeable and that aged\nmalls require greater investment and inducement by the landlord to attract retailers and restaurants to less than ideal\nspace Mr Wilmot noted that his income potential is significantly handicapped Mr Wilmot asserts that the PILOT\npromises the 45 year old malls continued vitality for 25 years Mr Wilmot noted that the additional job generation\nthat the project will create must not be overlooked Mr Wilmot stated that if the company is unable to secure an\nagreement for this PILOT the company will be unable to move ahead with the project and will continue to pursue\nthe grievance that has been filed on the current assessment of the BonTon parcel\nThere being no further speakers the Public Forum was closed\nMike Loewke of

me begin by saying I am not a fan of government tax incentives or subsidies The\nfact that these incentives do exist is the reason we are here today we are not here to\ndiscuss the overriding issue of IDAs Any reforms to the existing framework would\nneed to be addressed at the state level\nWe are here today to discuss the application before us I have a responsibility as the\nSupervisor of the Town of Greece to look at each application made to COMIDA as it\nimpacts the Town of Greece and all of its taxpayers\nElected leaders are often criticized for thinking only in the short term and considering\nimpacts that are for the next budget year only rather than financial decisions which\ntake into consideration the long term financial health of their communities With\nrespect to this application long term decision making strategies must be at the\nforefront Having a Mall in decline is not in the best interests of the overall economic\nhealth of our community for the long term\nAs Eastman Kodak Company Monroe County and the Town of Greece work toward the\nreuse and redevelopment of Eastman Business Park it is important to keep in mind that\nwhen businesses decide on a new location they consider more factors than just those\nrelating to financial terms utilities and transportation The overall quality of life in a\ncommunity--the visual impression that it gives regarding whether it is a vibrant\nthriving community or is a community in decline--can send a strong message about the\nlong-term desirability of locating in that community\nIf you are business owner trying to do business in the state of New York you are already\nat a disadvantage The high level of competition requires businesses to seek out any and\nall avenues to improve their bottom line and thus foster growth\nGreece Ridge Mall is no different they must seek to improve to stay competitive\nMost successful commercial plazas have at least one anchor tenant whose vitality and\nability to draw customers is essential to the overall commercial vitality of the other\nbusinesses in the plaza and plaza as a whole In a very similar way the Mall is the\nanchor for all the businesses on West Ridge Road Without the Malls vitality and ability\nto draw customers the other businesses on West Ridge Road will suffer This will lead\nto an overall decline in sales and business activity which translates into a loss of sales\ntax revenue and assessed value (and thus property tax revenue)\nGreece Ridge is currently the lowest performing of Mall in our area It has not seen\nsignificant improvement in nearly 20 years The proposed expansion will help to ensure\nthe investment in this important economic asset We are dealing with a local company\nwith long term ties to the Rochester Area who seeks to make a further investment here\n1\n\f\nThere has been a great deal of misinformation regarding this PILOT agreement Let me\nprovide you with some basic facts\n Currently the Total assessed value of the 5 properties in question total\n$9183210000 and of that the Bon-Ton site assessed value is $420000000\nwhich represents 150082 sf of retail space on 977 acres of land This property is\nscheduled for demolition\n Without re-development of this property the assessed value would decrease\nsubstantially In addition if this project does not materialize as the mall ages\nthere will be further reductions in value both of assessments and sales tax\nrevenue\n The proposed addition of approximately 25000 sf of restaurants would stabilize\nthe assessment at the current value with a guaranteed increase at levels\ndetermined by the agreement and the potential of new projects and increased tax\nrevenues\n There are many mis-conceptions about assessments Assessments are not\ncorrelated to the rate of inflation they are market driven\n The project benefits all tax payers in the Town and secures a steady stream of tax\nrevenue without the uncertainty of decreasing values Also it will most certainly\nhave a positive impact on sales tax revenue\n The agreement does not lower the dollar amount paid in property taxes by the\nmall parcels\n There will actually be a reduction in overall square footage yet the annual\npayments will be based on current square footage levels\n The Greece Ridge Mall currently employs 2454 people The impact of this\nproject on job growth is not limited to just the expansion area but will impact\npositions throughout the entire Mall An additional 60 full time and 150 part\ntime positions would bring that total to 2664 the majority of these positions are\nheld on a part time basis by students in our school systems\nIn the spirit of trying to achieve positive results I have asked the applicant to directly\nsubmit to the school board all of the information that may not have been provided to\nthem as of this date\nThe Town of Greece supports entering into this PILOT agreement as it makes good\nfinancial sense for our community as a whole for the long term\n2\n\f", "scrapedatetime": "2014-02-03 23:25:18", "docurl": "http://www.growmonroe.org/files/file/Minutes/2012/MINUTES_2012_0619.pdf", "linktext": "Minutes", "pdfhash":
